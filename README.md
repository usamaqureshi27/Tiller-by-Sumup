As London based global payment services provider SumUp which mainly owns mobile point-of-sale (mPOS) acquired Tiller in 2021, I analyzed their data from devices with main Business Objectives:
- Highlight how data can be leveraged to grow a custromer business i.e. restuarant in this project.

## Data Processing and Cleaning
Data is processed and cleaned with the help of Python libraries by observing:

- Check for missing data with the help of conditional formating, removing and filling null values of columns\
- Correctly format required columns and their values

## Analysis Approach
Main analysis approach was to understand Revenue distribution over the time. Understanding Payment types based upon the times to find best sales time. Then in the end, categorize the data in to most profitable categories and products for a restaurant.
